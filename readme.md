- **`<footer>`**: Holds the footer information.

Each section is appropriately tagged to enhance readability and maintainability.

### CSS (`css/style.css`)

The CSS file styles the HTML elements to improve the visual presentation. Notable styles include:

- **Layout**: Flexbox is used for aligning items within containers.
- **Typography**: Fonts, sizes, and colors are defined for headings and paragraphs.
